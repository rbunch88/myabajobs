====================================================================================================================

Learn how you can leverage Vercel Image Optimization in your projects.

Table of Contents

Next.js (/app)

The following examples show how you can optimize your images on Vercel using your framework's image component. Use the framework switcher to see examples for your framework choice.

Vercel Image Optimization works out of the box with Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, and Astro.

1.  ### [Import images](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization/quickstart#import-images)
    
    Next.js provides a built-in [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image) component.
    
    app/example/page.tsx
    
    TypeScript
    
    ```
    import Image from 'next/image';
    ```
    
2.  ### [Add the required props](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization/quickstart#add-the-required-props)
    
    This component takes the following [required props](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#required-props):
    
    *   `src`: The URL of the image to be loaded
    *   `alt`: A short description of the image
    *   `width`: The width of the image
    *   `height`: The height of the image
    
    When using [local images](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) you do not need to provide the `width` and `height` props. These values will be automatically determined based on the imported image.
    
    The below example uses a [remote image](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#remote-images) stored in a `/public/images/` folder, and has the `width` and `height` props applied:
    
    app/example/page.tsx
    
    TypeScript
    
    ```
    <Image
      src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1627843240167-b1f9d28f732e"
      alt="Picture of a triangle"
      width={500}
      height={500}
    />
    ```
    
    If there are some images that you wish to not optimize (for example, if the URL contains a token), you can use the [unoptimized](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#unoptimized) prop to disable image optimization on some or all of your images.
    
    For more information on all props, caching behavior, and responsive images, visit the [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image) documentation.
    
3.  ### [Deploy your app to Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization/quickstart#deploy-your-app-to-vercel)
    
    Push your changes and deploy your Next.js application to Vercel.
    
    When deployed to Vercel, this component automatically optimizes your images on-demand and serves them from the [Vercel Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview).
