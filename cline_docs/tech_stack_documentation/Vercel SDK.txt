How-to

[Vercel SDK](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/sdk#vercel-sdk)
=============================================================

Learn how to use the Vercel SDK to interact with the Vercel REST API.

Table of Contents

The [`@vercel/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/sdk) is a type-safe Typescript SDK that allows you to access the resources and methods of the Vercel REST API.

[Installing Vercel SDK](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/sdk#installing-vercel-sdk)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To download and install Vercel SDK, run the following command:

pnpm

yarn

npm

```
pnpm i @vercel/sdk
```

[Authentication](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/sdk#authentication)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Vercel Access Tokens are required to authenticate and use the Vercel SDK.

Once you have [created a token](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token), you can use it to initialize the SDK as follows:

run.ts

```
import { Vercel } from '@vercel/sdk';
 
const vercel = new Vercel({
  bearerToken: '<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE>',
});
```

### [Troubleshooting](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/sdk#troubleshooting)

Make sure that you create a token with the correct Vercel [scope](https://vercel.com/docs/dashboard-features#scope-selector). If you face permission (403) errors when you are already sending a token, it can be one of the following problems:

*   The token you are using has expired. Check the expiry date of the token in the Vercel dashboard.
*   The token does not have access to the correct scope, either not the right team or it does not have account level access.
*   The resource or operation you are trying to use is not available for that team. For example, AccessGroups is an Enterprise only feature and you are using a token for a team on the pro plan.

[Examples](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/sdk#examples)
